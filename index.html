      <p>I am a 25-year-old from Viana do Castelo, and a Product Manager at West-Sea, but this fact does not fully define me in the slightest. I am a very active person, passionate about sports and nature. I consider people to be the essential key
        towards achieving success at any business, and I want to become a professional of excellence along with that mindset, through constantly developing my hard and soft skills.</p>

  <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

      <li><em>Consultancy Project @ <strong><a href="https://yogurtnest.com/" target="_blank">Yogurtnest</a></strong> 🥛 - 🔜 February 2016 | May 2016 🔚</em></li>
        <ol type="A">
          <li><p>Description:</p></li>
            <ul> <!-- verificar se dá para mudar o símbolo de quadrado para um círculo vazio no CSS-->
              <li>In a course at the University, Entrepreneurship, we were proposed to work on projects from different companies, including IKEA, SONAE, etc. Each company presented a pitch with the planned projects.</li>
              <li>Each student would choose a project to work on, based on the companies' proposals, and would be randomly assigned to a group that brought together students of the same option.</li>
              <li>I chose YogurtNest because, given that the Project would only last for one semester, I assumed that a good job on my part would have more visibility and impact if it was well delivered and would thus be more measurable.</li>
              <li>The company had a product with a lot of potential, except for not selling.</li>
              <li>With the exception of my team, all groups assigned to the Yogurtnest project decided to change the product, both in terms of design and features.</li>
              <li>In my view, this was a costly mistake. The company, a Start-up, was taking students from a University to solve its sales problem and all approaches to abrupt change to the product would not guarantee a profit, on the contrary, they would guarantee expense, as they would not sell what the company would have already produced at the time, and forced the company to invest in a new type of product, which would not necessarily guarantee a profit.</li>
              <li>Thus, I led my team to develop a fully scoped market study and design an iterated implementation map of the product in the market, identifying and focusing on a targeted market.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><p>Accomplishments:</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The company was extremely satisfied with our work and pointed out that we did exactly what they were looking for, a studied strategy. They proceeded with the implementation and achieved notable improvements.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
      <li><p><em>Production Consultant - <em>Curricular Internship</em> @ <strong><a href="https://craftdp.com/" target="_blank">Craft Dream Productions</a></strong> 🔨 - 🔜 October 2018 | May 2019 🔚</em></p></li>
        <ol type="A">
          <li><p>Description:</p></li>
            <ul> <!-- verificar se dá para mudar o símbolo de quadrado para um círculo vazio no CSS-->
              <li>I joined the company, on the part of the University (Master's thesis project), as a consultant whose objective was to improve a factor within the business process.</li>
              <li>The business process was based on being an intermediary between the final customer and subcontracted production, providing designs of luxury furniture pieces from the company or requested by the customer.</li>
              <li>Roughly speaking, the improvement was based on improving the compliance of delivery deadlines. The company was severely disorganized regarding production and therefore, together with a friend Computer Engineer, I developed an internal tool to rank production priorities using Scheduling criteria (computation). Thus, the internal management could organize its production using the FIFO, Shortest Delivery Time, Critical Ratio criteria, etc. It took about a month and a half to deliver a thoroughly tested MVP, with 2 months to spare for implementation.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><p>Accomplishments:</p></li>
            <ul>
              <li>This Project was a success, as the developed product was able to raise the percentages for both deadline compliance and customer satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

          <ol type="A">
            <li><p>Day-to-day:</p></li>
              <ul> <!-- verificar se dá para mudar o símbolo de quadrado para um círculo vazio no CSS-->
                <li>As part of the Production team, I am responsible for obtaining the approval of the final product. The final products are steel blocks and all types of steelwork required to carry out subsequent work within the construction.</li>
                <li>Stakeholders in this industry include Welders, Assemblers, Maritime Client Inspectors, Classification Societies, Production, Quality, Coordination, Contractors, among others.</li>
                <li>My day-to-day life involves monitoring steel inspections, on which my main goal is focused on obtaining product approval from Surveillance Inspectors to grant permission to other departments to proceed with their work on the Vessel.</li>
                <li>The way I deliver my work is through constantly negotiating and including Stakeholders in the working process. Consequently, I cultivate good relations and manage to bargain dynamic deliverables, according to what future work requires at that moment.</li>
                <li>Whenever necessary, I am required as an assistance figure to solve production problems, as well as hostile communication barriers between Stakeholders. This is something that my job constantly demands and that I willingly deliver.</li>
                <li>I co-manage the Pre-Assembly Workshop, as I am currently learning from the eldest and most experienced Hull Construction Specialist of the Shipyard</li>
              </ul>
            <li><p>Accomplishments:</p></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Under 6 months of work, I was promoted to Co-Manager of the pre-assembly workshop, a vote of confidence on the part of West-Sea which is greatly appreciated.</li>
                <li>I delivered the fastest approved ship, to all steel works, ever since the beginning of West-Sea's industrial activity.</li>
